# Envirochem
Back in 2011, I developed a simple website for my current employer, Envirochem Analytical Laboratories.

# Features
The website dynamically handled many pages, a simple blogging platform, and gallery.

# Technology
The bulk of the application was was built entirely from pure PHP, making no use of additional libraries. Some jQuery was used for animations.
