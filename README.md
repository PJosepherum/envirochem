# Envirochem
Back in 2011, I developed a simple website for my current employer, Envirochem Analytical Laboratories. The applicaiton was built entirely from PHP and made use of no additional frameworks.

# Features
The website dynamically handled many pages, a simple blogging platform, and gallery.
