	<h2>Envirochem removed encapsulated and unencapsulated asbestos insulation over-spray from support beams for Control Technique Dynamics</h2>
	<p>and were contracted to completely replace the ceilings and install modern energy saving lighting which we gained a grant for from the government and proved the savings to the client's board of directors in France.</p>
	<p>Envirochem managed and offered the complete package at the best price to fit the clients time restraints and allowing continued unaffected work within the factory. Envirochem utilised asbestos licensed scaffolders, electricians, ceiling fixers, and asbestos removers. Keeping the continuation of the project and overflow of the trades was a logistical difficulty that we completed smoothly.</p>
	<p>We built a bird cage scaffold to allow asbestos removal works to be carried out above the warehouse floor. Works were completed in five phases with a consultant on site throughout giving confidence to the workforce.</p>
	<p>Upon completion the warehouse was returned back with a new ceiling at a lower level giving a cleaner look. Lighting was increased at a lower voltage but higher level thus improving working conditions.</p>
