	<h2>Envirochem has been Environmental Consultants to <a href="http://www.bournemouthairport.com/" target="_blank">Bournemouth International Airport</a> for over six years</h2>
	<p>We continue to offer environmental advice and assistance to the airport as it expands its facilities to become the biggest and busiest airport in the south of England.</p>
	<p>Our surveyors are in the process of reinspecting the airport for the management of asbestos to assess the current state of any asbestos containing materials present, based on fully accredited surveys previously undertaken by ourselves, within the buildings and facilities of the airport. We are working closely with the Bournemouth Airport whilst to consider the health and safety of both workers and the public, to reduce time and cost by working efficiently, and to ensure the continued and undisturbed operation of the airport facilities.</p>
	<p>We were previously contracted to identify asbestos containing materials in poor condition and educate the client into the best course of action to control in accordance with asbestos regulations. We supervised the safe removal of asbestos insulation from beneath the floor of areas including a busy control tower, and delivered a high standard of reinstatement to both ceilings and ducting insulation. Another major aspect of our services to the airport was our <a href="?p=asbestos&t=awareness">asbestos awareness program</a>, which raised understanding amongst workers and airport staff about the safety and control of asbestos.</p>
