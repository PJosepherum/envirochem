    <p>We are able to provide Noise and Vibration Survey reports, which are often a planning condition of construction and demolition projects, and are used to demonstrate conformity to any conditions stipulated by the local authority, to assess the environmental and social impact of noise and vibrations created during work, and to offer reassurance to residents of the surrounding areas.</p>

    <p>Light scattering technology can be utilised to determine the ambient concentration of airborne particles (PM<sub>10</sub> or PM<sub>2.5</sub>) in the surrounding environment, which can be monitored to a fraction of a microgram per cubic meter, to facilitate reports and alerts of dust levels in the area.

    <h1>Real time monitoring</h1>
    <img class="floatleft" src="/images/alert.jpg" height="120" />
    <p>To facilitate the mediation of environmental impact caused by excess noise and vibration during the high impact works, real time monitors can be installed at boundaries between the site and nearby residential areas which will alert the site manager if a predetermined limit is breached</p>
    <p>Survey reports include a summary of all occurrences of excessive noise, vibration or dust particulates.</p>
