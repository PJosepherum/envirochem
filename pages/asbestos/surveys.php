    <p>Envirochem undertake management and major refurbishment/demolition asbestos surveys in accordance with our UKAS accreditation based upon <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/books/hsg264.htm" target="_blank">HSE Guidance Note Asbestos: The survey guide (HSG 264)</a>.  We also undertake re-inspection surveys of buildings which have previously undergone management (previously known as type 2) asbestos surveys.</p>
    <p>The report is tailored in every way to the client's needs and can include supplementary information if provided. Reports are produced at our offices using asbestos survey management software, and are available in special formats if required. A signed digital copy of the report is emailed to the client following quality checking.</p>
    <p>Asbestos surveys are quoted on an individual basis. Please <a href="?p=branches">contact us</a> for a free asbestos survey estimate! Provide as much detail as possible about the scope of your project including the size, age, usage, location and any other relevant information about the property.</p>

	<h1>Management asbestos surveys</h1>
    <p>This type of survey is non-intrusive and is undertaken during normal occupancy to identify and then manage all reasonably accessible asbestos containing materials.</p>
	<ul class="list">
        <li>Executive summary of identified asbestos containing materials, recommended actions and areas of no access</li>
        <li>Introduction and initial observations</li>
        <li>Areas of no access</li>
        <li>Detailed assessment of each room</li>
        <li>Asbestos fibre identification report</li>
        <li>Asbestos material assessment</li>
        <li>Table of negative samples</li>
        <li>Photographs of positive sample locations</li>
        <li>Annotated site plans showing all sample locations</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Major refurbishment / pre demolition asbestos surveys</h1>
    <p>This type of survey involves intrusive inspection to locate all asbestos containing materials so that they can be removed and is necessary when a building is to be upgraded, refurbished or demolished. They are generally undertaken in buildings which are vacant and/or unoccupied.</p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Executive summary of identified asbestos containing materials, recommended actions and areas of no access</li>

	<h1 id="reinspection-asbestos-survey" class="clear">Re-inspection surveys</h1>
	<p><a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/asbestos/regulations.htm" target="_blank">The Control of Asbestos Regulations (CAR) 2012</a> specify that identified asbestos containing materials must be re-inspected every 6 to 12 months but more frequently in high disturbance environments. This re-inspection of the condition of the known asbestos based materials will ensure the asbestos material assessment always contains current information. Also any damage caused by disturbance or any deterioration will be identified and therefore remedial work can be undertaken to reduce the risk to building users.</p>
