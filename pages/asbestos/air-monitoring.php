    <h1>Background air monitoring</h1>
    <p>Background air monitoring is conducted to establish airborne fibre concentrations prior to any activity that may lead to airborne asbestos contamination or in specific locations with known asbestos based materials.</p>
	<h1>Leak air monitoring</h1>
    <p>Leak air monitoring is carried out outside the enclosure/work area while work is in progress. It is undertaken to verify that the control measures are adequate to control asbestos fibre release to the outside.</p>
    <h1>Four stage clearance air monitoring</h1>
    <p>Four stage clearance air monitoring is undertaken following the removal of asbestos based materials (generally notifiable materials such as insulation boards, insulation and coatings) under fully controlled conditions. This will enable a certificate of reoccupation to be issued to reassure those reoccupying the area that it is safe to do so.</p>
	<h1>Reassurance air monitoring</h1>
    <p>Reassurance air monitoring is conducted to determine asbestos fibre concentrations upon completion of the assessment of site for reoccupation (final stage of four stage clearance air monitoring) or following the removal of non-notifiable asbestos containing materials (such as vinyl floor tiles, cement products, textured coatings) or following the disturbance of suspected or identified asbestos containing materials.</p>
	<h1>Personal air monitoring</h1>
    <p>Personal sampling is conducted to assess whether or not the personal exposures of workers comply with the relevant control limits and to determine the suitability of respiratory protective equipment being used.</p>
