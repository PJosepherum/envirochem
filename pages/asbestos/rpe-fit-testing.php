	<h2>An inadequate fit will significantly reduce the protection provided by the RPE and may lead to serious immediate and long-term health problems</h2>
    <p>The performance of all RPE face pieces, whether operating by negative pressure, power assistance or compressed air, relies heavily on the quality of fit of the face piece to the wearer's face.</p> 
    <img class="center" src="/images/respirators.jpg" /> 
    <p>Fit testing is available on-site or at our laboratory for full-face, half-face, ori-nasal and P3 disposable masks. Additionally we offer training in the correct use of respiratory protective equipment (RPE).</p>

    <h2>The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 requires all employers to take satisfactory precautions to protect their employees in the workplace</h2>
    <p>Under the revised Health and Safety Executive Legislation (2002), fit test reports should be available for all employees who wear respiratory protective equipment (RPE) incorporating tight fitting face pieces. Fit test records should be retained by the employer and be available for inspection upon request [CAW reg.7(3)(d)]</p>
    <p>Regulation 11 of the control of asbestos regulations (2006) states that fit testing of face pieces must be pertained for tight fitting face pieces. Repeat testing is required when changing size or model of RPE, or with significant changes in facial characteristics of the wearer. The HSE recommend that fit retesting be carried out on a regular basis, especially for workers involved in licensed asbestos removals.</p>
