    <p>Our most recent high profile job involving the supervision of licensable work with asbestos centred around the demolition and redevelopment of <a href="http://www.soton.ac.uk/estatedevelopment/projects/mce.html" target="_blank">Building 62, Biomedical Science Building, Boldrewood Campus</a> on behalf of the <a href="http://www.soton.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Southampton</a>.</p>
    <p>Following the undertaking of a 10 week major refurbishment/demolition asbestos survey by one of our dedicated asbestos survey teams we undertook direct supervisory control over a 40 strong team of contractors undertaking asbestos works over a 20 week period.</p>
    <p>Work had to be carried out efficiently and accurately in order to meet the client's brief for safe asbestos removal in a short duration in order to facilitate a speedy demolition and subsequent hand over of the site to the new landowners by a pre-stipulated date in Autumn 2011.</p>
