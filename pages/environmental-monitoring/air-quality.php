    <h1>Air quality surveys</h1>
    <p>Air Quality Survey reports can be created from data gathered by routine monitoring in conjunction with weather sensors which can also be included to measure wind speed and direction, which can also be used to demonstrate adequate environmental and safety controls during demolition or other dust creating projects, and configured to alert site operatives upon exceeding a predetermined limit based on a prior survey of the ambient air quality in an area.</p>
    <h1>Gravimetric dust sampling</h1>
    <p>Gravimetric dust sampling is also available, to collect physical samples of airborne particles for analysis of their chemical composition and concentration. Our personal sampling equipment takes samples representative of its user’s rate and volume of respiration over a period of time.</p>
